# EarAid
A Celeste mod allowing the volume of certain (obnoxious) sounds to be adjusted. sorry kevin

Sounds currently supported:
- *Ridge Wind:* The wind ambience used in Golden Ridge.
- *Farewell Wind:* The wind ambience used in Farewell.
- *Lightning Strike:* The crashing sound used when lightning strikes occur.
- *Golden Death:* The death gong sound used when the player dies with a golden berry.

If you have a sound you'd like to be supported, give me a shout in [Celestecord's](https://discord.gg/celeste) #modding_feedback, via dm at caeyo#0477, or leave a request in the Issues tab.
Support for other sounds (from vanilla or mods) can be added with little trouble, but in the interest of not overloading the menu I won't be adding every sound under the sun.
