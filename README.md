- *Ridge Wind:* The wind ambience used in Golden Ridge.
- *Farewell Wind:* The wind ambience used in Farewell.

If you find any issues or have a sound you'd like to be supported, give me a shout in [Celestecord's](https://discord.gg/celeste) #modding_feedback, via dm at caeyo#0477, or in the Issues tab.
Support for other sounds (from vanilla or mods) can be added with little trouble, but in the interest of not overloading the menu I won't be adding every sound under the sun.
